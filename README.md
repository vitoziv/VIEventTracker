```Objc
[VIEventTracker trackEvent:@"test" handler:^(NSUInteger times) {
    if (times == 3) {
        // Handle some special action when this event tracked 3 times
        //......
        NSLog("Already track 3 times, cool!!!");

        // Stop track the event when you complete track, then this block will never be called.
        [VIEventTracker stopTrackEvent:@"test"];
    }
}];
